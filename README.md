# Tableau

This repository contains a course on Tableau that will take a complete Tableau novice to a level of business proficiency. Tableau is not only highly user friendly, powerful and beautifully artistic, it is absolutely essential for analytics and business intelligence. Whether you are trying to get your first role in data analytics, business intelligence or wish to simply brush up on your skills, this course will be a highly practical way to make you perform like a pro. Learning a skill like Tableau will open up career doors that you thought were not applicable to you.

In this course we will explore a wide variety of techniques to analyse data. We will first discuss the topic that we are covering then put our learnt knowledge into practice by using the tools Tableau has to offer. Regardless of your current level of knowledge, I am sure this repository will be of use. Please see below the list of topics that will be covered and the order in which they should be approached. This makes the course easier to navigate incase you only need to learn a specific topic. I hope you enjoy the course as much as I have enjoyed making it and teaching students and colleagues just like you.
