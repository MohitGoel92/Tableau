# Tableau

This repository contains a course on Tableau that will take a complete Tableau novice to a level of business proficiency. Tableau is not only highly user friendly, powerful and beautifully artistic, it is absolutely essential for analytics and business intelligence. Whether you are trying to get your first role in data analytics, business intelligence or wish to simply brush up on your skills, this course will be a highly practical way to make you perform like a pro. Learning a skill like Tableau will open up career doors that you thought were not applicable to you.

In this course we will explore a wide variety of techniques to analyse data. Unlike traditional courses, or even the courses I usually make, there is no theory. This course is 100% practical as Tableau is highly intuitive, and you just need to get familiar with the tools that Tableau offers and how to use them.

Regardless of your current level of knowledge, I am sure this repository will be of use. Please see below the list of dashboards we will produce. The dashboards will start basic and then get more involved with each step, so we will be building on our gained knowledge one step at a time. I hope you enjoy the course as much as I have enjoyed making it and teaching students and colleagues just like you.
